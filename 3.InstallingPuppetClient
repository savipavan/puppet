Create Repos For Puppet-Labs : Most distributions still ship puppet 3 in their internal repositories. To be able to make use of the latest Puppet 4 code when we must first setup software repositories pointing to puppetlabs.
Package Collection Repository CentOS : Puppet-Collections are new to puppet4 and ensure that all dependency packages such as heira, facter and ruby come from the same repository ensure most compatability with the client.
#sudo rpm -Uvh \ https://yum.puppetlabs.com/puppetlabs-release-pc1-el-7.noarch.rpm
Package Collection Repository Ubuntu : The process for Ubuntu is similar. Here we use the code name of "trusty" for the 14.04 repository.
#wget https://apt.puppetlabs.com/puppetlabs-release-pc1-trusty.deb
#sudo dpkg -i puppetlabs-release-pc1-trusty.deb
#sudo apt-get update

Adding repositories
--------------------
We are going to add the repositories on both CentOS and Ubuntu Nodes
Configuring The CentOS 7 Puppet Repository
------------------------------------------
#id - can see wheel group
#ctrl + l clear the screen
#sudo yum install -y http://yum.puppetlabs.com/puppetlabs-release-pc1-el-7.noarch.rpm
#yum repolist - list repository and can see Puppet Labs PC1 repository
------------------------------------
ConfiguringTheUbuntuPuppetRepository
------------------------------------
Ubuntu 14.04 LTS because Ubuntu 16.04 LTS and CentOS 7 are too similar as both use systemd hence we are using Ubuntu 14.04
#wget https://apt.puppetlabs.com/puppetlabs-release-pc1-trusty.deb
#ctrl+l
#id
#sudo dpkg -i puppetlabs-release-pc1-trusty.deb
#sudo apt-get update
