Create Repos For Puppet-Labs : Most distributions still ship puppet 3 in their internal repositories. To be able to make use of the latest Puppet 4 code when we must first setup software repositories pointing to puppetlabs.
Package Collection Repository CentOS : Puppet-Collections are new to puppet4 and ensure that all dependency packages such as heira, facter and ruby come from the same repository ensure most compatability with the client.
#sudo rpm -Uvh \ https://yum.puppetlabs.com/puppetlabs-release-pc1-el-7.noarch.rpm
Package Collection Repository Ubuntu : The process for Ubuntu is similar. Here we use the code name of "trusty" for the 14.04 repository.
#wget https://apt.puppetlabs.com/puppetlabs-release-pc1-trusty.deb
#sudo dpkg -i puppetlabs-release-pc1-trusty.deb
#sudo apt-get update

Adding repositories
--------------------
We are going to add the repositories on both CentOS and Ubuntu Nodes
Configuring The CentOS 7 Puppet Repository
------------------------------------------
#id - can see wheel group
#ctrl + l clear the screen
#sudo yum install -y http://yum.puppetlabs.com/puppetlabs-release-pc1-el-7.noarch.rpm
#yum repolist - list repository and can see Puppet Labs PC1 repository
------------------------------------
ConfiguringTheUbuntuPuppetRepository
------------------------------------
Ubuntu 14.04 LTS because Ubuntu 16.04 LTS and CentOS 7 are too similar as both use systemd hence we are using Ubuntu 14.04
#wget https://apt.puppetlabs.com/puppetlabs-release-pc1-trusty.deb
#ctrl+l
#id
#sudo dpkg -i puppetlabs-release-pc1-trusty.deb
#sudo apt-get update
-------------------------------
Installing the Client : On both Ubuntu and CentOS systems we can now installl the All in One Client. To ensure that the package will not clash with the standard repositories the package name is puppet-agent
---------------------
#sudo yum install puppet-agent #CentOS
#sudo apt-get install puppet-agent #Ubunut
#ls -l /opt/puppetlabs/bin  
-----------------------
--------------------------------
Understadning The File Locations:
--------------------------------
Binary Locations :
A subset of executables are available in : /opt/puppetlabs/bin. This is added to the PATH variable.
Other executables are in /opt/puppetlabs/puppet/bin. This is not in the PATH and makes it less likely these makes it less likely these programs will be used in error
------------
Main Configuration
-------------
The main configuration directory is : /etc/puppetlabs/puppet. The main configuration files is puppet.conf
This makes Puppet Open Source now consitent with Puppet Enterprise
----------------
Display Data : We can use the puppet command to display configuration data
#puppet agent --version
#puppet config print
#puppet config print confdir	
#puppet config  print certname
#puppet config print { confdir rundir ssldir runinterval }
